# Fusion
Fusion is a machine learning library

## Installation and dependencies
You need python, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#uv), make
```bash
git clone https://github.com/plagache/fusion
cd DSLR
make setup
make run
```

## Objectives
Understand machine learning framework and autograd with the [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) of [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), and then add the tensor class.
A Tensor containing a multidimensional array, in our case based on numpy ndarray.

### Build small machine learning framework to complete the MLP project of 42
    - [x] dot
    - [ ] softmax
    - [x] sigmoid
    - [x] log

### Build and train a small neural network to detect handwritten digits
    - [x] Relu
    - [x] div
    - [x] exp
    - [ ] pow
        - [ ] * itself ^N times
