# Fusion
Fusion of different machine learning tools

## Objectives
Create a machine learning framework based on the [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) of [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/) with the addition of a tensor class based on numpy.

## ToDo

- [ ] Tensor class / Automatic differentiation
    - [ ] Simple derivatives with context (what created the next value / parent / operation)
    - [ ] Backpropagation with topological sort based on Chain of rules
- [ ] Optimizer
    - [ ] GD
    - [ ] SGD
    - [ ] ADAM
- [ ] Preprocessing
    - [ ] pandas
    - [ ] datasets
    - [ ] hugging face
- [ ] graphviz of the network / topological sort
- [ ] Math
    - [ ] Advenced math function with scikit
- [ ] Statistics / describe of data
- [ ] Plot
